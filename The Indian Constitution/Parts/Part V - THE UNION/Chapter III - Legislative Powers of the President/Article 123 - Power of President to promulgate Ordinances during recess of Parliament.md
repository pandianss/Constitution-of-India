(2) An Ordinance promulgated under this article shall have the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament, but every such Ordinance -
	(a) shall be laid before both the Houses of Parliament and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the Parliament (or) if before the expiration of that period resolutions disapproving it are passed by both Houses, upon the passing of the second of those resolutions; and
	(b) may be withdrawn at any time by the President.

(3) If and so far as on Ordinance under this article makes any provision which Parliament would not under this Constitution be competent to eneact, it shall be void.
